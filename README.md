# anecdotea

Anecdotea is a mobile application for localize anecdotes around the position of the user.

For example, it can be used in a touristic place with many points of interests.

The technology is very simple. There is no revolution inside. 
The idea is to use the current location of the user and the mobile vibrator for notify him.
The user is notified when he is localized near a point of interest (with an anecdote).
The goal is to propose a non intrusive user experience and work first on the quality of the content. 
I like the idea of Lo-Fi augmented reality (it interacts with the environment but at minimal).

The project is currently under construction.

It uses Ionic (Cordova, AngularJS, Material Design).

My city (Rochefort, France) is the perfect place for trying this idea dans will be the first city for the content.
